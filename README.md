# Delay Pedal

## Description
Selectrable 4 Head delay with Echorec timing

The delay spacings are set like the Echorc (1/16 note, 1/8 note, dotted 1/8 note, 1/4 note - or 0.25,0.5,0.75,1).
Any combination of the 4 heads can be set with 4 push buttons.
There are currently 4 paramater knobs.
- Dry/Wet
  - Controls how much of the dry and wet signal is head. Min 0 acts as a pass through for dry signal and Max 1 only outputs delays
- Feedback
  - Controls how much the delays feedback into themselves. Min 0 does 1 repeat Max 1.1 Repeats forver
- Tone
  - Controls the freq. of the delays. Min 0 is LP filter maxed out Max 1 is HP filter maxed out
- Time
  - Controls the speed of the delay heads. Min 0 is 20 BPM Max is 240 BPM

There is also a tap tempo button that averages out the taps to have a smooth bpm change.
The time knob will only change BPM when it reaches the current BPM 
i.e if BPM is tapped to 200 and time knob is at 30, moving the time knob will do nothing until it reaches 200 BPM
